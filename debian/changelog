eblocker-dns (2.4.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfix: requests received via the internal Redis queue dns_query are now
    resolved with addresses_for(), so CNAMEs are resolved to IP addresses.
    This is necessary since some domains like fritz.box are now officially registered
    CNAMEs. This fixes issue [#8].

eblocker-dns (2.4.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Bugfix: eblocker-dns used to return NXDOMAIN for AAAA requests
    of blocked domains. Now an empty response is returned so the
    clients don't assume the domain does not exist.
